# How to make a StateMachine DSL in Kotlin?
Kotlin is known as a powerful and flexible language. DSL(Domain-Specific-Language) is one example that Kotlin could shine. 

## I. DSL
DSL is a code, but it's is a more readable code. Its code is like human language. Take a function about time for example, normally we would write a function like this: `func ago(number: Int, unit: TimeUnit)`, so we could call it by : `ago(3, TimeUnit.YEAR)`. In the meantime, DSL would looks like this: `3.YEAR.ago`. That's why we say DSL is more readable. 

DSL is used in many libraries nowadays. Gradle is another example. Gradle is using Groovy by default, but you can use Kotlin as well. And Gradle is a pure DSL on building apps.
