## Introduction
Recently I have been working one of my personal app : SixMall. I wrote a "OneAdapterForBinding" for the RecyclerView, which works fine. However I knew there is a similar library called "Epoxy" which is made by Airbnb. So I decided to look into the Epoxy library a bit, to see if there is something that I can take advantage of.

However, with respect to Airbnb, the Epoxy sample is quite a mess for a developer who never uses Epoxy before. It takes you quite a lot to time to understand the sample because it requires you know and understand Litho, lottie, data-binding, ... 

We know, sometimes, you don't use data-binding, or Litho. Most of time, you don't use Litho. Litho is a UI rendering framework made by Facebook. To tell the truth, I don't see any other companies is using Litho. So the high standard of this sample makes it very hard to grasp. And that's why I write this post. I want to show you a couple of simple examples of Epoxy, to help you understand this great library.
