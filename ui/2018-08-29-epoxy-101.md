## I. Introduction
Recently I have been working one of my personal app : SixMall. I wrote a "OneAdapterForBinding" for the RecyclerView, which works fine. However I knew there is a similar library called "Epoxy" which is made by Airbnb. So I decided to look into the Epoxy library a bit, to see if there is something that I can take advantage of.

However, with respect to Airbnb, the Epoxy sample is quite a mess for a developer who never uses Epoxy before. It takes you quite a lot to time to understand the sample because it requires you know and understand Litho, lottie, data-binding, ... 

We know, sometimes, you don't use data-binding, or Litho. Most of time, you don't use Litho. Litho is a UI rendering framework made by Facebook. To tell the truth, I don't see any other companies is using Litho. So the high standard of this sample makes it very hard to grasp. And that's why I write this post. I want to show you a couple of simple examples of Epoxy, to help you understand this great library.

## II. Hello Workd -- Epoxy


### 1. The Paint Point of RecyclerView
First of all, we need to know what's the pain point of existing RecyclerView. 

1). You need to write an Adapter for each RecyclerView. It contains quite a lot boilerplate.
(p.s.  I wrote a **[OneAdapter](https://github.com/songzhw/SixUiViews/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/six/open/view/rv/OneAdapter/OneAdapter.java)** to fix this problem. You can use this `OneAdapter` for every RecyclerView)

2). If one RecyclerView has many item tyeps, then you need to write a lot of ugly `if/else` chain in the Adapter code.

3). Every time you remove or add one item type, you need to modify the Adapter, and to be careful to make the existing logic failed.  This is definitely violate the Open/Close Principle.

So my **[OneAdapter](https://github.com/songzhw/SixUiViews/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/six/open/view/rv/OneAdapter/OneAdapter.java)**, and Airbnb's **[Epoxy](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy)**, are both trying to fix this by using "composition", rather than "inheritance".

### 2. What's Epoxy?
Epoxy abort the Adapter & ViewModel usage. You now can add every item you need. 

Here is a pseudocode:
```Java 
controller = new EpoxyControlelr()
controller.add(headerModel)
    .add(contentModel01)
    .add(contentModel02)
    .add(contentModel03)
    .add(bottomModel)
controller.bind(recyclerView)
```
This is not strict, precise code, but it realy tells you how the Epoxy works. Now we started to take a look at the simplest demo of Epoxy.

### 3. A Sample
The most important class in Epoxy is `Model` and `Controller`. 
* `Model`: describes how your views should be displayed in the RecyclerView
* `Controller`: describes the data and models.


What we will achieve is a RecyclerView that looks like: 

![](./_image/2018-08-29-23-57-24.jpg)

#### (1). row of header

```kotlin
import com.airbnb.epoxy.ModelView

@ModelView(autoLayout = ModelView.Size.MATCH_WIDTH_WRAP_HEIGHT)
class HeaderView @JvmOverloads constructor(
        context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet? = null, defStyleAttr: Int = 0
) : LinearLayout(context, attrs, defStyleAttr) {

    init {
        LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.item_dev_only_header, this, true)
    } // item_dev_only_header.xml contains only one ImageView

}
```

#### (2). row of content
This row need to retrive one text from Epoxy's controller.

```kotlin
import com.airbnb.epoxy.ModelView
import com.airbnb.epoxy.TextProp

@ModelView(autoLayout = ModelView.Size.MATCH_WIDTH_WRAP_HEIGHT)
class ContentView @JvmOverloads constructor(
        context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet? = null, defStyleAttr: Int = 0
) : LinearLayout(context, attrs, defStyleAttr) {

    init {
        LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.item_dev_only_content, this, true)
    } // item_dev_only_content.xml only has one TextView, whose id is R.id.tvItemContent

    @TextProp
    fun setContent(text : CharSequence){
        tvItemContent.setText(text) // the "text" arg is from Epoxy's controller
    }

}
```



#### (3). Controller
Consider the following code:

```kotlin

import com.airbnb.epoxy.TypedEpoxyController

class EpoxyDemoController01 : TypedEpoxyController<List<CharSequence>>() {

    override fun buildModels(data: List<CharSequence>) {
        HeaderViewModel_()
                .id("001")
                .addTo(this)

        for (str in data) {
            ContentViewModel_()
                    .id(str.hashCode())
                    .content(str)
                    .addTo(this)
        }

    }

}
```

1). Since the HeaderView does not need any data, so we just use one argument, which is CharSequence, for this Controller.
If the HeaderView needs a `Int` parameter to populate the header view, then you may need to make the Controller extend the `Typed2EpoxyController<Int, CharSequence>`

2). Each model needs an id. Otherwise, you will get a crash: "You must set an id on a model before adding it. Use the @AutoModel annotation if you want an id to be automatically generated for you."

3). the `addTo(controller)` method actually makes models a part of this controller.

#### (4). Activity
