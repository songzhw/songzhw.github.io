## Introduction
From now on, I will write a series of posts about how to custom a View (and a ViewGroup). I have to admit that customing a View that is meet your special need may be very difficult, and gotting what your need exactly needs a lot of practise and experience. At least, these series posts are a good start to do that. <p>
I know a lot of theory makes you want to sleep, believe me, I’ve read hundreds of such posts full of theory, and no example or few examples. So my series post would be different. I would like to import examples to help you understand each theory. <p>
Now let’s begin our beautiful and tough journey.
