# The Difficulties in the Android app
- the annoying boilerplate code, such as findViewById(), setOnClickListener() ...
- God class : Activity
- Android do not hava a clean MVC framework
- Multi thread handling is complex
- (Java) file stream, try-catch, no block, no first-class function, no AOP ...


## Problem 1 : boilerplate

In this blog, we only talk about the problem one : boilerplate. 

### A sample from old time
A typical Activity class is like this:
```java
public class HomeActivity extends RootActivity implements OnClickListener{
	private ImageView ivHead;
	private ImageView ivSetting;
	private TextView tvUserName;
	private ImageButton ibGo;
	private Button btnCancel;
	private Button btnCamera;
	private Button btnAlbum;
	private Button btnBack;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        this.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_home);

        ibGo = (ImageButton)findViewById(R.id.btn_card);
        ibGo.setOnClickListener(this);
        TextView tvCardCount=(TextView)findViewById(R.id.tv_card_count);
        // ...
    }


    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        if (v == ibGo&&LoginUtil.isLogin()) {
            // ...
        } else if (v == btnCancel&&LoginUtil.isLogin()) {
            // ...
        } else if (v == btnCamera&&LoginUtil.isLogin()) {
            // ...
        } else if (v == btnAlbum) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

We have to find every view in the laout and cast it to the correct type.

And we have to setOnClickListener() to some views.
Even if we just need a onClick(), but we still need to transfer a interface/class to the setOnClickListener(listener) function.

When you have been writing these boring codes for more than two, or five years, you will feel annoying and be tied to a rotten system.

How can we fix this?

### Solution 01 : Annotation for view injection

There are some brilliant library to support view injection to help us.
And Butterknife is a famous one. It manages to use annotation to help use to eliminate these boilerplate.

Here is one example:

```java

class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @Bind(R.id.user) EditText username;
  @Bind(R.id.pass) EditText password;

  @BindString(R.string.login_error)
  String loginErrorMessage;

  @OnClick(R.id.submit) void submit() {
    // TODO call server...
  }

  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);
    // TODO Use fields...
  }
}

```

We can see it helps us a lot :

- Eliminate findViewById calls by using @Bind on fields.
- Group multiple views in a list or array. Operate on all of them at once with actions, setters, or properties.
- Eliminate anonymous inner-classes for listeners by annotating methods with @OnClick and others.
- Eliminate resource lookups by using resource annotations on fields.

These library are good, but I still have to type R.id.*** and @Bind, @BindString....<br/>
I am still not satisfied.

### Solution 02 : Songzhw's groovy script
<a href="https://github.com/songzhw/android-toolkit">https://github.com/songzhw/android-toolkit</a> is my own tool kit to help reduce the boilerplate. 

Right now, you only have to do is to give the script some arguments, and my script will automatically generate Activity (from R.layout.****.xml) , Model, Adapter, Request, Response (from a json response string). 

- Json2Request : read a json , and parse it to java classes : **Request, **Response
- AutoFindViewById : read a layout xml, and parset it to Activity

The one benefit is of course you no need to write same and boring codes again and again.

And the other benefit is you can custom the script as you wish. It is very easy to change the script, and get what you own required result. 

Weak point: You have to install Groovy first, and switch from cmd/shell and AndroidStudio/Eclipse when you want to use this tools. It is not so much convenient.

p.s : I have two version of this script tool: python and groovy. But the first one is lost, and now I only the code of grovvy version.

Welcome to star it, and rebuild it in your version!


### RoboBinding

I will go throught the RoboBinding framework later, so now I would not talk too much about it. But RoboBinding, using MVVM, can really reduce huge code for us!

benifit : Writing code is simple and having fun. 

weak point: RoboBinding seems to generate some classes, which may expand our method count in Android app.   Android app has a limit of 65536 for method count, and too much method also means a heavy app for us. So I do not want import too much methods and classes.

### Kotlin 

Kotlin is a programming language invented by JetBrain, the same company provides Intellij IDEA and Android Studio. 

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language))

Development lead Andrey Breslav has said that Kotlin is designed to be an industrial-strength object-oriented language, and to be a better language than Java but still be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin. 

Kotlin has plenty of syntax sugar  comparing to Java : lambda, delegate, monkey patch, ...

Using the offical plugin "kotlin extensions for Android" (Jetbrains), we can eaily reduce the boilerplate.

Here is the sample:
[layout/activity_home.xml]
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical" android:background="#fff">

    <include layout="@layout/view_toolbar" android:id="@+id/topHome"/>


    <android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout
         android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent">

        <!-- content -->
        <LinearLayout android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent" android:orientation="vertical">
            <android.support.v4.view.ViewPager android:id="@+id/vp_home" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="170dp"/>
        </LinearLayout>


        <!-- menu -->
        <LinearLayout  android:id="@+id/llayHomeMenu" android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="fill_parent"
            android:layout_gravity="start" android:background="#fff" android:orientation="vertical"
            >

            <TextView android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="60dp"
                android:textSize="22dp" android:textColor="#000" android:gravity="center_vertical"
                android:text="... ..."
                />

        </LinearLayout>

    </android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout>
</LinearLayout>
```

[java/com/six/sample/HomeActivity.java]
```java
package com.six.sample

import kotlinx.android.synthetic.activity_home.*

public class HomeActivity : BaseActivity(){
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_home)

        var toolbar = topHome as Toolbar
        toolbar.title = "  Home Page!!"
        toolbar.setNavigationIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)

        var adapter = HomePagerAdapter(this)
        adapter.data = emptyList()  // error：java.lang.ArithmeticException: divide by zero
        vp_home.adapter = adapter
    }
}            
```


All you have to do is :

 1.  import the specific layout in one go:
```java
import kotlinx.android.synthetic.activity_home.*
```

 2.  now we can call the views by calling their id, like topHome, vp_home above.
So you do not need to findViewById() and cast the view.
```java
var toolbar = topHome as Toolbar
vp_home.adapter = adapter
```


p.s : Kotlin has many other convenience for programmer, and we will talk about Kotlin again and again in many blogs later.


###conclusion

My groovy script, RoboBinding, Kotlin are three good ways to eliminate the biolerplate.  And I tent to use Kotlin right now, because kotlin has plenty of benefit for the programmer. Kotlin is not as fun as Ruby, but it is surely more fun than Java.
