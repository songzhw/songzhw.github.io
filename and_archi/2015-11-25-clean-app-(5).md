# An example in real life

We list all the usable payments in the process of pay, like account balance, debit cards, credit cards ...  So, we have a page like this:

![](/imgs/20151125_01.jpg)

Now, we want to transfer money from one bank card to account balance.

![](/imgs/20151125_02.jpg)

Of course, we should give the user the chance of shift from one bank card to another bank card.

So we need to reuse the page in two different situations. However, the click event in each situation is different, and the UI in each situation has a little difference too. That means , we should reuse the View, and put the unreusable part to the specific Presenter. Yes, we should have one View, and two Presenter classes.

Since the data in two situations both includes account balance and multiple bank cards, so one Model is enough.

Here is what I do:

#### [View]
```java
public class PaymentsActivity : BaseActivity(){
    var adapter : PaymentsAdapter by Delegates.notNull()
    var presenter : IPaymentPresenter by Delegates.notNull()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_payments)

        var type = intent.getStringExtra("showType").toInt()
        when(type){
             0 -> presenter = NormalPayPresenter(this)
             1 -> presenter = DepositePresenter(this)
        }
        adapter = PaymentsAdapter(this)
        presenter.init()

        lvPayments.adapter = adapter;
    }

    fun refreshWholePage(items : MutableList<IPaymentItem> ){
        adapter.data = items
        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

}
```

Note that the presenter reference in View is an interface. So later I can pass different specific Presenter classes as my wishes.



#### [Model]
```java
public class PaymentsModel {
    var payments : MutableList<IPaymentItem> by Delegates.notNull()

    fun initData(){
        // omit the process of getting data from server or db in Presenter

        var balance = AccountBalance()
        var citiCredit = CreditCard("citi")
        var citiDebit = DebitCard("citi")
        var royalCredit = CreditCard("royal")
        payments = arrayListOf(balance, royalCredit, citiCredit, citiDebit)
    }
}
```
Here we mock a communication with server, and get a result data.


#### [Presenter -- IPaymentPresenter]
```java
public interface IPaymentPresenter{
    var model: PaymentsModel
    val view : PaymentsActivity

    fun init()
}
```
This is the abstract of our presenter.

#### [Presenter -- NormalPayPresenter]
```java
public class NormalPayPresenter(val actv : PaymentsActivity) : IPaymentPresenter {
    override var model : PaymentsModel by Delegates.notNull()
    override var view : PaymentsActivity by Delegates.notNull()

    override fun init() {
        view = actv
        model = PaymentsModel()

        // omit the process of getting data from server or db in Presenter
        model.initData()
        view.refreshWholePage(model.payments)
    }

}
```
When you pay normally, of course you can pay with cash(balance), credit card or debit card.<br/>
so here we do not filter the whole data.


#### [Presenter -- DepositPresenter]
```java
// deposite from one of my bank debit cards to account balance
// note: credit card can not be used to deposit. It's maybe money laundering.
public class DepositePresenter (val actv : PaymentsActivity) : IPaymentPresenter {
    override var model : PaymentsModel by Delegates.notNull()
    override var view : PaymentsActivity by Delegates.notNull()

    override fun init() {
        view = actv
        model = PaymentsModel()

        // omit the process of getting data from server or db in Presenter
        model.initData()
        var debits : MutableList<IPaymentItem> = arrayListOf()
        model.payments.forEach { item ->
            if(item.type == "Debit Card"){
                debits.add(item)
            }
        }
        view.refreshWholePage(debits)
    }

}
```
For money laundering's sake, I have to hide credit card in the deposite process. That means I have to reuse the view, but the specific logic codes are different.<br/>
So I abstract the changable part to the Presenter.
