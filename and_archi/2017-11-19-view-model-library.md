## 1. Why Do You Need Another Library: ViewModel?

### 1.1 You need to handle the configuration change
The configuration change is totally out of your control. Last minute, your user is using your app. Next minute, he/she switch out and change a configuration(i.e. rotate the screen), your app may remove your current Activity and re-create it again. This is completely out of your control, but you have to deal with it. 

I know some developer would say, "It's okay for me. My project just make sure every Activity's orientation is portrait. So I have no such problems." But screen rotation is just one example of configuration change. You can make your Activity portrait, but you can forbit your user to change the language, or font size. Every time the user changed the language, like from English to Chinese, your activity will get notified this is a configuration change, and it may get removed and re-created. And you, as a developer, have to deal with it.

So, **The [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ViewModel.html) class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations**. 

### 1.2 Why onSaveInstanceState() is not enough for us?
A tranditional way to handle the configuration change is to save data in the onSaveInstanceState() and to restore the data in onCreate(). 

But there are two limits about onSaveInstanceState(). 
1. onSaveInstanceState() can not save a large amounts of data. I've seen some posts that some developer saved a lot of data in the onSaveInstanceState(), and they got a `TransactionTooLargeException`.
2. The data you want to save in the onSaveInstanceState() must be serializable. So you'd better to use Parceable (Serializable is not a good option for Android applications). This is not just creating a class and making it implement Parceable. Sometimes the data is from third-party liarbry, and you can not modify the data. So for some scenarios, it's hard to save data in onSaveInstanceState().

## 2. A Simplest Demo
**Step 01** - Create your ViewModel class
Just make it extend ViewModel. 
```java
public class ZeroViewModel extends ViewModel {
    public User user;
}
```

**Step 02** - use it in the Fragment/FragmentActivity
```java

public class ZeroDemo extends AppCompatActivity {
    private TextView tv;
    private ZeroViewModel vm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_tv_btn);
        tv = findViewById(R.id.tv_simple);
        
        vm = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(ZeroViewModel.class);
        System.out.println("szw vm.user = " + vm.user);
    }
    
    // android:onClick="onClickSimpleButton"
    public void onClickSimpleButton(View v) {
        vm.user = new User(23, "jorden");
    }
}
```
Note that `ViewModelProvides.of()` needs a Fragment or a FragmentActivity as a parameter. 
By the way, AppCompatActivity is a subclass of Fragment, so you can pass an AppCompatActivity object here.

You can rotate screen now, and you will find out the value of `vm.user` is always there. That's what the ViewModel's for.


## 3. Different Instance of One Activity Class

### 3.1 Having two instance at the same time
Let's do an experiment. Here is the code.

```java
public class SameClass01 extends AppCompatActivity {
    private TextView tv;
    private ZeroViewModel vm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_tv_btn);
        tv = findViewById(R.id.tv_simple);

        vm = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(ZeroViewModel.class);
        System.out.println("szw SameClass01 : " + vm.user);

    }
    // launch the second instance
    // android:onClick="onClickSimpleButton"
    public void onClickSimpleButton(View v) {
        vm.user = new User(100, "SuperMario");
        startActivity(new Intent(this, SameClass01.class));
    }
}
```

And when the second launch is created, the log is :
`I/System.out: szw SameClass01 : null`

So even you have two instance of one Activity, the ViewModels is not a mess. The ViewModel in the first instance holds the "Mario" user, and the ViewModel in the second instance holds the null user. 

### 3.2 Creating the second instance later
Now if I open SameClass02 (an Activity), save one user onto ViewModel, then exit SameClass02. 
Later, I open SameClass02 again, what value would I get from the ViewModel's user.

```java
public class SameClass02 extends AppCompatActivity {
    private TextView tv;
    private ZeroViewModel vm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_tv_btn);
        tv = findViewById(R.id.tv_simple);
        vm = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(ZeroViewModel.class);
        System.out.println("szw SameClass02 onCreate() : " + vm.user);
    }
    // android:onClick="onClickSimpleButton"
    public void onClickSimpleButton(View v) {
        vm.user = new User(22, "test");
    }

    // android:onClick="onClickSimpleButton2"
    public void onClickSimpleButton2(View v) {
        System.out.println("szw SameClass02 : saved = "+vm.user);
    }
}

```

From the log, `System.out: szw SameClass02 onCreate() : null`, we are glad to see the ViewModel is not messed.

## 4. Static, An Alternative?

### 4.1 Experiment 01 : Rotate Screen
I was told ViewModel can survive through configuration change. And the previous code shows if your activity exit, the data on ViewModel would be erased.  So I was wondering, this seems a job of static value. 

Let's write some code to verify that. 

```java
public class SameVm {
    public static User user;
}
```

And then save the value in the Activity. 

```java
public class ZeroDemo extends AppCompatActivity {
    private TextView tv;
    private ZeroViewModel vm;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_tv_btn);
        tv = findViewById(R.id.tv_simple);

        String value = savedInstanceState == null ? "emptyBundle" : savedInstanceState.getString("key");
        System.out.println("szw onCreate() " + value);

        vm = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(ZeroViewModel.class);
        System.out.println("szw vm.user = " + vm.user);

        System.out.println("szw static = "+SameVm.user);
    }

    // android:onClick="onClickSimpleButton"
    public void onClickSimpleButton(View v) {
        vm.user = new User(23, "jorden");
        SameVm.user = new User(21, "king");
    }
}

```

After rotating the screen,  we save the value:
```
szw vm.user = User{id=23, name='jorden'}
szw static = User{id=21, name='kingâ€™}
```

So we still have the same user after we rotating the screen when we are storing the user object as a static value. 

### 4.2 Experiment 02 : Terminate Application
Same code, but this time we do something different. After executing onClickSimpleButton(), we put the app to the background. Then terminate the application. And then bring the app again.

Here is what happened. The log showed the ViewModel and static value can not both survive the application termination.
```java
szw vm.user = null
szw static = null
```

### 4.3 Then What's the Difference?
You now can see that static value and ViewModel seems no different. They can both survive the configuration change, and they neither can survive the application termination. 

But they do have some difference
1. [Design] ViewModel is designed as a decouple part. Just like the Preseneter in the MVP, ViewModel is the VM in the MVVM pattern.  So you can do asyncronous operations in the ViewModel to fetch data, you can change the data and let the View know the change (you may need the [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) to do that.)
2. [Saving Value] The static value can be modified by every class. But the value in the ViewModel is activity-local variable, which is like [ThreadLocal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html) class.
