## I. Introduction
Fragment has been made since 2011 for the support of tablet on Android 3.0+. The original intention is that it can help us to write once, but two different UI for phones and tablets.

But this seems only works for the list. More complex UI is hard to fulfill this goal. However, smart developers found out that Fragment actually could do a single part of UI View, so we could compose different Fragment to one screen, and, oh yearh, we could reuse our View code. Wasn't it wonderful?!

I was one of these excited developers. But after several years of using Fragment, I have to say, Fragment is one of the worst product in the Android world. Wait a minute, I am not here to declare a war, please allow me to explain more details.
