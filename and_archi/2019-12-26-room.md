Room has been out for serveral years, I haven't used it until this year. And I do learn a lot this time, and would like to take a note of it.

Before I dive in, I would say, the version of Room I'm using is :

```
def room_version = "2.2.2"

    // ROOM
    implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version"
    kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_version"
    implementation "androidx.room:room-ktx:$room_version" // ktx + Coroutine
```

By the way, you can check [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) to see the release log of Room.

## Relation
The first thing I would state is the relation in ROOM. As we all know, if you have multiple tables and there might be 1:1, 1:Many, Many:Many relation among these tables.

I would like to explain how to build a many to many relation using Room, as this is the hardest relation for us.  Say I have a recipe database, which has two tables: "ingredient" and "recipe". The relation between ingredient and recipe, of course, are many to many. Here is how we retrieve data from Database

1). We define the entities first

```kotlin

@Entity
data class Ingredient(
    val name: String,
    val isVegi: Int,
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) var ingredientId: Int = 0
) 

@Entity
data class Cuisine(
    val name: String,
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) var cuisineId: Int = 0
)

```

Note that we have to have one, and only one, field annoated with @PrimaryKey in every Entity class.
p.s. You could add @ForeignKey as well.
