# Http Cache

## Cache-Control
Cache-Control has a `maxAge` which is how many seconds do you want to keep this cache. When the cache is valid, then browser will remember the resposne and will never ask the server for you. 

## etag
Cache-Control is apparently for suitable for the resources that are not gonna change for a long long time. What if your resource might change after a serveral days?

`eTag` is here to rescue you. You can add this etag value in your `if-none-match` request header, so server would know which version your last request is. If no changes in the server, server will no bother reading database to get your the full values. Instead, server will just send you a `status code = 304`. This way, server's workload is lighter. 

# Android
Nowadays, nearly everyone is using OkHttp or Retrofit. If you are not, I strongly suggest you to do so. With the help of OkHttp, implementing the `eTag` on Android is quite easy. 

All you need to do, is just to add a `Cache` class to the `OkHttpClient` instance.
