# Http Cache

## Cache-Control
Cache-Control has a `maxAge` which is how many seconds do you want to keep this cache. When the cache is valid, then browser will remember the resposne and will never ask the server for you. 

## etag
Cache-Control is apparently for suitable for the resources that are not gonna change for a long long time. What if your resource might change after a serveral days?

`eTag` is here to rescue you. You can add this etag value in your `if-none-match` request header, so server would know which version your last request is. If no changes in the server, server will no bother reading database to get your the full values. Instead, server will just send you a `status code = 304`. This way, server's workload is lighter. 

# Express
To test how the eTag is handled on mobile, we need an API endpoint to return a resposne with eTag. Here we used Node.js and Express to do so

```js
var express = require("express");
const { getIPAddress } = require("../utils/utils");
var app = express();

app.get("/data", (req, resp) => {
  const requestVersion = req.headers["if-none-match"];

  const eTag = "W/20220303";
  resp.setHeader("ETag", eTag);

  if (eTag === requestVersion) {
    console.log(`szw /data 命中etag`)
    resp.statusCode = 304;
    resp.end();
  } else {
    console.log(`szw /data 无匹配, 返回新数据`)
    resp.json({ id: 23, name: "apple", price: 1.2 }); 
  }

});

app.listen(8890, function() {
  console.log(`server started at ${getIPAddress()}:8899...`);
});

```


# Android
Nowadays, nearly everyone is using OkHttp or Retrofit. If you are not, I strongly suggest you to do so. With the help of OkHttp, implementing the `eTag` on Android is quite easy. 

All you need to do, is just to add a `Cache` class to the `OkHttpClient` instance.

```kotlin
            val folder = MainApp.app.cacheDir
            val cache = Cache(folder, 5 * 1024 * 1024)
            val okhttp = OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .cache(cache)
                .build()
```                

Then OkHttp will save your response if it has `eTag/Last-Modified/Cache-Control`. The caches are actually two files. One file to save the response details, such as status code, header, ....; and another file is to save the resposne body.


```kotlin

// file one 
http://192.168.2.246:8899/data
GET
0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
9
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 36
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
X-Powered-By: Express
ETag: W/20220303
Date: Sun, 06 Mar 2022 22:31:53 GMT
OkHttp-Sent-Millis: 1646605913423
OkHttp-Received-Millis: 1646605913425


// file two
{"id":23,"name":"apple","price":1.2}

```


# iOS
iOS actuall yjust did it for your, so you actaully don't need to config one line of code to get the ability of Cache.

```swift
       let url = URL.init(string: "http://192.168.2.246:8899/data")!
        let req = URLRequest.init(url: url)
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: req) { (data, responds, error) in
            let respString = String(data: data!, encoding: .utf8)
            print("szw resp = \(respString)")
        }.resume()
```        

The `URLSession` class actually has a inner `URLCache` class to help cache the result for us.

One thing to mention is although the backend returns a `304 (Not-Modified)`, but iOS will translate it to 200 and give you the cached resposne. So you always get 200, even if the server gives you a 304. 


# Flutter
The most popular http libraries are : `http` and `dio`. Here we are using `dio` and the `dio-cache-interceptor` library to get the work done. 

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
  dependencies:
    dio: ^.0.4
    dio_cache_interceptor: 3.2.6
```

```dart
// HttpEngine
class Http {
  static CacheOptions cacheOptions = CacheOptions(store: MemCacheStore());
  static Interceptor cacheInterceptor = DioCacheInterceptor(options: cacheOptions);
  static Dio dio = Dio()
                      ..interceptors.add(cacheInterceptor);
}

void httpGet(String url) async {
  try {
    var response = await Http.dio.get(url);
    print(response.data);
    print(response.headers["eTag"]);
  } catch (e) {
    print(e);
  }
}

// The UI Page
httpGet("http://192.168.2.246:8899/data");
```
