# The Good book I've read in 2019
2019 is already far away from us. I'm glad I did learn a lot in 2019. I've switched from an Android Developer/Architecture to a full-stack(ish?) developer. I've learned Node.js in 2018, and this year I spent 10 months in React/React Native app in my company. 

One thing that helps me a lot is books. I've read many books in 2019. Some of them are good, and some of them are not that interesting. 

## Bad Books

### 1. <JavaScript设计模式与开发实践>

This is a book about javascript design pattern in Chinese. I have to say most of the content are boiling. I expected to see more real-world issues we may had in the developement in JavaScript. But no, most of the content are simple and out-of-date examples. 




### 2.  Land the Tech Job You Love

This book contains resume, applying for a job, interview, after interview... It seems okay. That's my thought. But it turned out that the book is full of cliché. I really did not find anything useful or interesting. Sorry, this book is not good for me.

This book is about taking notes using MindMap. MindMap could help you explore your brain, and get more and more ideas and details. 



This book also introduced many other approaches to take notes, like 5R of notes ... They are all interesting and helpful.



But one shortcoming of this book is that the way it suggested us is to use paper and pen. This is against my habits. I prefer to do thing on computer, so I can check it everwhere without carrying any heavy notebooks. Plus, it's much easy to remove and add stuff in computer than notebooks.
