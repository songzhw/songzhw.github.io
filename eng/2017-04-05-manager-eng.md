Do you think they are literally idiots? Let me give you a little feedback right now, so you can understand what I'm seeing. 

- On a practical level, it's really difficult to have a strong working relationship with someone you don't respect.  And you language says you don't respect them.
- I never thought of it that way. 

If you think of them as your colleagues, and try to imagine their point of view, you'll have a different perspective.
