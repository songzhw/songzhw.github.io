Do you think they are literally idiots?

refer to colleagues in other departments as idiots,  I wouder how it affects your ability to work with them

On a practical level, it's really difficult to have a strong working relationship with someone you don't respect.  And you language says you don't respect them.



4. 承接工作/需求相关

email Sb. to ask for help. 

sb is pushing for this work

This change is not easy or fast to make

They think they are just asking for UI changes, but it turns out that the change have a ripple effect.

just plan for two weeks in a time

This is a problem we have to work on as a management team. It's bigger than your group or any one group. 










5. 角度相关/情绪

the practices in this blog can be adapted and applied to most situations
use the wrong approach
Do you think they are literally idiots? Let me give you a little feedback right now, so you can understand what I'm seeing. 

- On a practical level, it's really difficult to have a strong working relationship with someone you don't respect.  And you language says you don't respect them.
- I never thought of it that way. 

If you think of them as your colleagues, and try to imagine their point of view, you'll have a different perspective.


6. 培养人/团队/士气
English                  |  Translation

8. 会议

9. 成果/目标/进度/解决问题
meet the release date: we need more people to meet the release date.

work on together : This is an issue that we need to work on together as a management team

develop an action plan
develop goals for the next few months
accomplish the team goal/individual goal

keep people on one feature at a time

Feature B is next in line

plan ahead

root problem, not the symptoms


10. 沟通
- You want to talk about your conversation with sb.?
- It didn't go well.   He doesn't ....  Now what? Are you going to talk to his boss. 
- Let's review what happened, and then we'll talk about next steps. 

First, let's look at it from one's point of view, what does he lose by doing this?

You maybe right. What do you think he'll gain? Can we make a case with sb. about what he wins and address his concerns about what he loses?

11. 变化
shorten the schedule by two months

responde to this change
... Has good reasons to make this change
meet those expectation

prioritize what we work on first
what may fall off the plate

originally estimated we need five months

I can't guarantee what we'll be able to deliver

It's pointless to argue with him. I need to first work with my team to see what we can deliver

work overtime
put everyone on overtime
burn everyone out doing sth.
Overtime makes people tired, ..., we can't afford mistakes. So we're not going to do sth. we know will hurt us more than help us. 
Even we work overtime, we couldn't accomplish everything.

manage expectations with the customer

organize the features and arrive at an achievable plan

figure out how to get this much done

If you see a better way, let me know.

We know what our capacity is, and we're at it.

- What if you put everyone on overtime? Or hire more people?
- The learning curve is too steep. 
New hires won't be up to speed before the release date. And extended overtime(过长的加班) would guarateen the developers make too many mistakes and the testers will be tired to find them.

We did it. Didn't complete everything Jim wanted, but we did enough to make customer be happy. And we didn't burn anyone out doing it.




*. 
It's worth doing sth. : 值得做...

not just get the release out, have to get it out in good shape
