OCP, SIP, LSP, DIP

-- conform to OCP ;  if OCP is applied well, 
-- violate OCP

If OCP is applied well, further cahnges of that kind are achieved by adding new code, not by changing old code that already work. 
What are the traps that will cause us to create hierarchies that do not conform to OCP?
This change immediately satisfies both DIP and OCP.

requirements change
extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes

be closed against (new change)
close ...(function) against ...(change)
   : close the drawAllShapes function against ordering issue

the likely kinds of change
how do we know which change are likey?

LSP: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

remain consistent with sth.

影响(其它系统，其它类)
app layer is unaffected by any changes to the lib layer.
When once client forces a change on the fat class, all the other clients are affected. 
break the fat interface into many client-specific interface

分解大类
: The fat interface can be broken up into groups of methods. 
: avoid such coupling when possible
: Fat interface cause harmful coupling between its clients. 

[Development]
However, there is a way to sidestep the problem.

Each group serves a different set of clients.
