Google asked every app to upgrade the app to use targetSDK 33 by August 31st. Upgrading your codebase is not very hard, just check the [Android 13 features and change list](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/summary) and we can get a idea what code we should change. But I got a bunch of issue after I upgrading the targetSDK.

## issue 1: Android Studio(AS) Smart completion is gone
I'm using Android Studio BumbleBee when I upgraded the targetSDK. And after the upgrading, I just found out some smart completion is gone, such as

or

After I downgrade the targetSDK to 31, then these missing smart completion are all coming back. Now I know it's the targetSDK get this issue. 

It seems my AS is not supporting the new SDK, Api levle 33, very well, so I have to upgrade my AS as well. Also the Android Gradle Plugin(AGP) is related to the version of AS as well, according to [here](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin?buildsystem=ndk-build#android_gradle_plugin_and_android_studio_compatibility)

So when I upgrade the AS, I have to upgrade AGP as well.
