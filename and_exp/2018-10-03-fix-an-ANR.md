## What's the issue

I've been logging in Firebase once in a while to see the crash log or any other issues. I just find out we have an ANR in the splash page. Lucky for us, Firebase also provided the ANR trace file for us. So it would much easier to reproduce or figure out what went wrong.

By searching our app's package name, I quickly got why users were stopped at the splash page and can't get into our app.  It appears that the SpalshActivity's `Completable.blockingAwait()` is the main cause. 

## Dig into the code

So the problem is back to who is calling this `blockingAwait()` method. I went digging into the code and find out it's the A/B testing configuration issue. The detail is that we need to fetch the A/B test configuration from the server in the splash page. If we don't get the configuration due to any unpleasant reason (like no network access), PO just decided that user should not get into our app as we don't know it's a type A user or type B user.
