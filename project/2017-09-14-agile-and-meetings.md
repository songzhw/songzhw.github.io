Agile needs communication. That’s true. But sometimes this could be an excuse for having too much meetings. From my observation many years, I found out the most time killer is meeting. Some developers and managers could spend 4 or even more hours attending meeting every single day. If that’s the case, for a developer,  how do you have time to write code, to refactor, to write unit test? Or if you are a manager, then you will definitely have no enough time to talk to your people, to understand what they are thinking and what they are going through. 

Here is some observation I had in the last couple of years, and I thought about how to improve it. Today I want to share them with you.

### Stand-Up Meeting
Stand-up meeting on every morning seems a standard part of agile team. But you need to pay a little more attention to it, otherwise your stand-up meeting would be less efficicent.

Here is a scenario you might have every day
* A big team’s stand-up meeting. Even everyone just talked one minute, then this stand-up meeting may take you 30 minutes. Valuable 30 minutes!
* Someone are really talktive. This person will talk more than 3 minutes. But most of it are just useless detail.
* Some update are really short. Like this one, “I was working on home page yerterday, and I’ll continue working on that. No blocks”.  His manager would be hard to get more information from this update. What progress do you have, are you able to finish it on time, are you finished the functionality, accessibility, and UI?
* This is a stand-up meeting in payment team. But somehow some other developers or managers are giving their updates here too. 

These are very common scenario, and you might hate it that it took so much time. Time is the most precious thing, and you cannot have the lost time back. So we want to spent the time carefully and wisely. We want to communicate with everyone, in a efficient way, and we do not want to waste everyone’s precious time.
