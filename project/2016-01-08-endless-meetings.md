# Endless Meeting?

We've all been there. There is your development job, and there's one meeting after another. How can we keep away numbers of meetings.



## 1. Inviting the right person
A significant sign of you've invited the wrong people is people who come to attend your meeting with laptop in their hands.

Maybe they are not involved, they just "**maybe**" involved. And for this "maybe" , they may waste three hours in the afternoon. 

Or maybe they are only one part of it. A 2-hour meeting, they may be asked to speak in 15 minutes. Then why not talk to them before the meeting in 15 minutes. In that case , you've already waste others's 15 minutes, because others are not interested. 


## 2. Preparing for the meeting

If you want to discuss with only one or two person, do it before the meeting. Do your homework before meeting, and then everyone is prepared and the meeting is short.

If some part of topic are only involve one or two person, please talk to them. A worse, worse option is to open a big meeting with other ten uninvolved people to watch you two discussing. 


## 3. "5-minute dispute" principle
If you all cannot settle a dispute in 5 minutes, then you also are not likey to settle it in 30 minutes. So you should call off this topic and move on.  The arguing people can discuss it further after the meeting. 

## 4. Say no to some unnecessary meeting
Uncle Bob told us that programmer should be able to say "No" when the time is appropriate. So if you already know one meeting is none of your business, just say, "I am busy right now. Can I join you later?", or "Thi is mostly about back-end, and I am a mobile developer. You two can settle it without me, right?"
