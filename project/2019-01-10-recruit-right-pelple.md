# How to recruit better?

This post is most coming from what I did and felt in the past serveral years. I've interviewed with more than two hundred people in the last 4 years, and built a mobile team (Android + iOS) from scratch to a team of more than 20 person. I naturally have some thought about how to recruite righ people, and here I want to share it, discuss it with you.

## normal process
I personally think that the three essential task for a team manager are : 
* recruit right people
* manage people (team, supervisor)
* manage project
 
And all of these stem from the "recruting right people". So you may think of it as the most important thing you need to handle carefully. 

Our HR normally will screen some person for me, so what I got is some resume that are supposed to be valuable.  (And I've heard some complaint that HR may skip some valuable candidate, but I trust my HR team, and I think they know what they are doing. So I am happy with this process)

Then I will call the candidate by myself. I will ask him mostly about his background. What did you do? Which technology are you using? I will ask some technical question too, to make sure if this candidate is capable of doing our work.

Sometimes, I will ask one of my senior dev to do that, and I was sitting beside him. He will ask question, and I will take some notes. After the interview, I will ask his opinion about this candidate, and why is the candidate good or bad, adn also tell him what did he right, and what did him wrong as a interviewer in this process. The reason I delegate this job is I want to help senior dev to find out what a manager's job is like, and if he is interested in such management work. Some dev are happy to take such job, some dev don't like it and just want to finish the feature they got. I respect their choice. However I do find out some senior dev who want to become a manager in the future are quite pleased with this opiton. They felt their opinions are respected, and also were happy to have a chance to something else rather than coding.

If the candidate passed the phone screen, we will invite him to our company, and I will spend 40-90 min to talk to him. The length of the time depends on how good is this candidate. If he is really good, then I will ask many technical questions in different aspect, to see how good is him and what's his strength and what's is his weekness.

After this, I will write a report to my boss and HR. I will list the conclusion (conclusion first. I know my boss are really busy) and the details if anyone is interested(what is this candidate good at, and what quality he lacks for this job). The detail I listed can also help us sometimes. I do have one time, failed one candidate in one time. But we were opening a new project later,  and were short of people. So I opened my email, and dig it. Finally I could find the best one from a lot of candidates which we are not hired before, thanks to the detailed interview report. 

## FAQs

### 1. how do you tell if the candidate has potential
"Potential" is a word we are using frequently in the process of itnerview. However, I have to say, having a strong background does not means a great candidate. I've seen many such people failed the interview. Someone are graduated from one of the greatest university, and someone are who had worked on some great Internet company for several years. 

So the "potential" concept in my mind is not about your university or previous company. If you have been in this development industry for 3 years, and after the interview, I find out you have understand some things that is hardly within most of 3-year dev's mind, and you are happy to learn by yourself. I would say you are have potential. The more you know, the more potential you have. 

This principle do help me find many brilliant and potential developers. And the best part of it is you can apply it to anyone. Let's take an example of Android development, if you are just gradutated, and you know the details of MVP or other stuff and have some nice open source project, I would think you do have potential. But if you have worked as a Android developer for more than 5 years, and still don't know how to test your code, and also don't know a thing about Kotlin, I may question your experience. 

The thing I am mostly concerned is, if you don't learn enough things in 5 years of dev career, that's means you don't have the passion to learn things, or you still don't have a clue about this business. Then it's hard for me to expect you to learn more in my company, and output more in your position. 

Of course these two or three questions are purely examples.  Normally I will ask a lot of questions, to make sure I got your technical level in a big picture.  And this requires the manager to have quite a lot of technical background, and then understand which level this candidate is in. 

### 2. brilliant people, or people have such background?
Here is a scenario you may face many times in your manager career. Your team has a Android dev position open, however, you got two candidates that seems good for this position. 

Adam is just switching to be an Android dev for 1 years, after his 3 yearas as iOS developer. Adam is quite a brilliant people on iOS field. He open-sourced some great frameworks in GitHub, and he understood how a mobile dev team runs well. 

Bob is a Android dev with 4 year experience. He understood more Android dev knowledge than Adam, and faced more difficulty than Adam. However, after taking with Bob, you find out he lacks some key points as a Android dev, such as testing, how to make code elegant and expandable, why AsyncTask is bad for our code. 

So here is the question: Which one do you pick if they are identical in other filed except technique?

The answer may vary. But mine is quite simple: Adam.
This is not what I think. It is also I did. For this choice, I did recruite a brilliant people for our team. 

The reason of picking Adam is that I will choose someone have more potential. If you worked very well in other field, I expect you will do it in this new field. If you are bad at your work, or not that good at your work, then I can question you in the future. I may think you may not have enough passion for technique.
