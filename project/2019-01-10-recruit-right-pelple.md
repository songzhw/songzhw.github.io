# How to recruit better?

This post is most coming from what I did and felt in the past serveral years. I've interviewed with more than two hundred people in the last 4 years, and built a mobile team (Android + iOS) from scratch to a team of more than 20 person. I naturally have some thought about how to recruite righ people, and here I want to share it, discuss it with you.

## normal process
I personally think that the three essential task for a team manager are : 
* recruit right people
* manage people (team, supervisor)
* manage project
 
And all of these stem from the "recruting right people". So you may think of it as the most important thing you need to handle carefully. 

Our HR normally will screen some person for me, so what I got is some resume that are supposed to be valuable.  (And I've heard some complaint that HR may skip some valuable candidate, but I trust my HR team, and I think they know what they are doing. So I am happy with this process)

Then I will call the candidate by myself. I will ask him mostly about his background. What did you do? Which technology are you using? I will ask some technical question too, to make sure if this candidate is capable of doing our work.

Sometimes, I will ask one of my senior dev to do that, and I was sitting beside him. He will ask question, and I will take some notes. After the interview, I will ask his opinion about this candidate, and why is the candidate good or bad, adn also tell him what did he right, and what did him wrong as a interviewer in this process. The reason I delegate this job is I want to help senior dev to find out what a manager's job is like, and if he is interested in such management work. Some dev are happy to take such job, some dev don't like it and just want to finish the feature they got. I respect their choice. However I do find out some senior dev who want to become a manager in the future are quite pleased with this opiton. They felt their opinions are respected, and also were happy to have a chance to something else rather than coding.

If the candidate passed the phone screen, we will invite him to our company, and I will spend 40-90 min to talk to him. The length of the time depends on how good is this candidate. If he is really good, then I will ask many technical questions in different aspect, to see how good is him and what's his strength and what's is his weekness.

After this, I will write a report to my boss and HR. I will list the conclusion (conclusion first. I know my boss are really busy) and the details if anyone is interested(what is this candidate good at, and what quality he lacks for this job). The detail I listed can also help us sometimes. I do have one time, failed one candidate in one time. But we were opening a new project later,  and were short of people. So I opened my email, and dig it. Finally I could find the best one from a lot of candidates which we are not hired before, thanks to the detailed interview report.
