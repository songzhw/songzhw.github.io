# How to recruit the right person?

This post is most coming from what I did and felt in the past several years. I've interviewed with more than two hundred people in the last 4 years, and built a mobile team (Android + iOS) from scratch to a team of more than 20 person. I naturally have some thought about how to recruit right people, and here I want to share it, discuss it with you.

## I. Normal Process
I personally think that the three essential task for a team manager are : 
* recruit right people
* manage people (team, supervisor)
* manage project
 
And all of these stem from the "recruiting right people". So you may think of it as the most important thing you need to handle carefully. 

Our HR normally will screen some person for me, so what I got is some resume that are supposed to be valuable.  (And I've heard some complaint that HR may skip some valuable candidate, but I trust my HR team, and I think they know what they are doing. So I am happy with this process)

Then I will call the candidate by myself. I will ask him mostly about his background. What did you do? Which technology are you using? I will ask some technical question too, to make sure if this candidate is capable of doing our work.

Sometimes, I will ask one of my senior dev to do that, and I was sitting beside him. He will ask question, and I will take some notes. After the interview, I will ask his opinion about this candidate, and why is the candidate good or bad, and also tell him what did he right, and what did him wrong as an interviewer in this process. The reason I delegate this job is I want to help senior dev to find out what a manager's job is like, and if he is interested in such management work. Some dev are happy to take such job, some dev don't like it and just want to finish the feature they got. I respect their choice. However I do find out some senior dev who want to become a manager in the future are quite pleased with this option. They felt their opinions are respected, and also were happy to have a chance to something else rather than coding.

If the candidate passed the phone screen, we will invite him to our company, and I will spend 40-90 min to talk to him. The length of the time depends on how good is this candidate. If he is really good, then I will ask many technical questions in different aspect, to see how good is him and what's his strength and what's is his weakness.

After this, I will write a report to my boss and HR. I will list the conclusion (conclusion first. I know my boss are really busy) and the details if anyone is interested(what is this candidate good at, and what quality he lacks for this job). The detail I listed can also help us sometimes. I do have one time, failed one candidate in one time. But we were opening a new project later,  and were short of people. So I opened my email, and dig it. Finally I could find the best one from a lot of candidates which we are not hired before, thanks to the detailed interview report. 

## II. FAQs

### 1. how do you tell if the candidate has potential
"Potential" is a word we are using frequently in the process of interview. However, I have to say, having a strong background does not means a great candidate. I've seen many such people failed the interview. Someone are graduated from one of the greatest university, and someone are who had worked on some great Internet company for several years. 

So the "potential" concept in my mind is not about your university or previous company. If you have been in this development industry for 3 years, and after the interview, I find out you have understand some things that is hardly within most of 3-year dev's mind, and you are happy to learn by yourself. I would say you are have potential. The more you know, the more potential you have. 

This principle do help me find many brilliant and potential developers. And the best part of it is you can apply it to anyone. Let's take an example of Android development, if you are just graduated, and you know the details of MVP or other stuff and have some nice open source project, I would think you do have potential. But if you have worked as an Android developer for more than 5 years, and still don't know how to test your code, and also don't know a thing about Kotlin, I may question your experience. 

The thing I am mostly concerned is, if you don't learn enough things in 5 years of dev career, that's means you don't have the passion to learn things, or you still don't have a clue about this business. Then it's hard for me to expect you to learn more in my company, and output more in your position. 

Of course these two or three questions are purely examples.  Normally I will ask a lot of questions, to make sure I got your technical level in a big picture.  And this requires the manager to have quite a lot of technical background, and then understand which level this candidate is in. 


### 2. brilliant people, or people have such background?
Here is a scenario you may face many times in your manager career. Your team has an Android dev position open, however, you got two candidates that seems good for this position. 

Adam is just switching to be an Android dev for 1 years, after his 3-year development as iOS developer. Adam is quite a brilliant people on iOS field. He open-sourced some great frameworks in GitHub, and he understood how a mobile dev team runs well. 

Bob is an Android dev with 4 year experience. He understood more Android dev knowledge than Adam, and faced more difficulty than Adam. However, after taking with Bob, you find out he lacks some key points as an Android dev, such as testing, how to make code elegant and expandable, why AsyncTask is bad for our code. 

So here is the question: Which one do you pick if they are identical in other filed except technique?

The answer may vary. But mine is quite simple: Adam.
This is not what I think. It is also I did. For this choice, I did recruit a brilliant people for our team. 

The reason of picking Adam is that I will choose someone have more potential. If you worked very well in other field before, I expect you will do the same in this new field. I appreciate your work before, and I believe you will work hard and work aggressively just like before. If you are bad at your work, or not that good at your work, then I can question you in the future. I may think you may not have enough passion for technique.



### 3. What if you can not recruit one perfect person?
You have time to recruit people, you have budget to  offer to a brilliant people, ... that's good, but it's not the situation you will have all the time. Sometimes, you don't have enough budget, or your new project have to be start in 1 month, and all the people you've interviewed are not that satisfied as you expected. What could you do?

#### 3.1 You have a hard deadline 
Let's say, you have an order to recruit 3 dev for a new project. Time is precious and short, you have make your choice. Sometimes you can't take enough time to get a perfect candidate, you have to pick one candidate that's is okay (not good enough though).  This kind of decision is the ones you have to make, so don't feel upset about yourself.

Just remember to mentor this new hire in the future, and also guide him in his technical career. You, as a tech manager, have responsibility to help your report grow and become better.


#### 3.2 You don't have enough budget
Let's still use the previous example. Let's say we have 400K budget for 3 dev. If that's the case, then I recommend you to at least hire one hight-level dev,  and two other intermediate dev. We could allow the senior dev to have 200K, and two other intermediate dev to have 100K each. 

My idea here is to make your team have different level. So you have tech leader to navigate the whole team, and also have solid dev to handle technical details.

### 4. What if you have a couple of "okay" candidate, but that are all you have?
Yes, this is a question you may face sometime. You have 3 candidate and a hard deadline, but none of them are not even close to your acceptable level. What now?

You have to understand that recruit is always hard. In China, the best time to recruit people is February. To be precise, before and after the Spring Festival. In Canada, it's January and February. After all, you want to get the bonus, then head to your next stop. So trying to hire a good dev in other months could be tough. There is just not so much candidate in the market.

When you have such a situation, try to list the qualification you valued in the white board, to see which candidate have the most check under each qualification. Just like this one: 

|       | kotlin | Optimization | Architecture | Test |Communication|
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|------|-------------|
| Adam  | 5      | 3            | 5            | 4    | 6           |
| Bob   | 7      | 1            | 4            | 2    | 4           |
| Celin | 2      | 4            | 4            | 3    | 5           |

We have 1-10 point in every filed we value. The fields are close related to your codebase and project. Let's say if you are using Daager2 in your codebase, and you don't want waste any time to let the new hire to learn Dagger2, you would prefer someone that knows some knowledge of Dagger2. Then the Dagger2 should be appear in the previous table.

To sum up, my advice is to list a table and make this making-decision process more like a data game.



## III. Be Polite
### 1. Respect your candidate
Normally I don't know if the person on the phone I'm talking to, or I was talking face-to-face is good or not. But I prefer to be polite to make a good first impression for me and for my company. 

If you are asking a series of question and keeping making it more difficult, that's okay. But don't contempt your candidate if he is answering one question totally wrong. Hide your feelings, you can list all his weakness after the interview, in your interview report. But don't show it to your candidate. On the contrary, you have to be polite and warm, to make him feel good, and make him calm down. A too nervous candidate may act terribly wrong, and you may miss one great dev.


### 2. Bring him some water
Also, I want to mention one more thing. After you meet your candidate face-to-face, please take a look if he has some water. He may have a 60- to 90- minute interview, he will definitely need it.  And if he is a Chinese, please bring him warm water. If he is a western, please bring him cold water. He will appreciate it even he don't manage to get into your company. 



## IV. Things I don't do in interview

### 4.1 I don't ask too difficult algorithm questions
I know this is controversial. A lot of company, even some huge Internet company like to ask candidates some difficult algorithm questions. 

However, I am a leader of mobile team. The most dev I need to recruit is Android dev, iOS dev, or React Native dev. Most of their work don't have too much to do with difficult algorithm. I prefer to ask some questions more practical. Like "What kind of algorithm have you used in your dev before?", "[xxxx] algorithm is often used to [zzzz], could you tell me more about it/ could you tell me how to improve it?"


### 4.2 too much behaviour questions
As a mobile team leader, my questions mostly covers the technical staff. I would take 1 to 1.5 hour to understand your technical background in every different filed (java, android, UI issues, architecture, test, security, optimization, new stuff(like Kotlin, RxJava, ..), open source, efficiency, ... ). But I don't ask too much behaviour questions. That's the job of HR or our CTO. They may don't have enough mobile dev background, so they would like to ask some behaviour questions to understand the candidate better. 


## V. Conclusion
I always to recruit the best people in the market, not the people that is more fit in this position. Because I believe brilliant people would be shine even in a new position. 

To help me to get the best person, I have to be good at technique. This will allow me to ask questions that is good enough, or deep enough to understand which level this candidate is.

Also I have to respect candidates. We are trying to choose one best out of them, and they are also choose one best company out of the companies he ever had interviewed with.

Hope you and your team will find more right person for your team in this new year. Happy New Year.
