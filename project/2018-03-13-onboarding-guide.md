# Onboarding Guide
I find there are not many blog talking about the onboarding guide, but I personally think this is quite important. That's why I wrote a post about it.

## 1. Why you should care about onboarding guide
If you are a manager and in charge of recruiting people, congratulations, you can make some important decisions for your team. But I have to warn you that candidates accepting your offer is not an end. I saw a couple of teams made this mistake. And this is a reason why I write this.

I personally think the most two important job of a team leader are : recruiting the right person, and managing the development process, so you can deliver a good product on time.

After you recruit a right peoson, this is just a begining. If you give the new hire a bad impression, and make them think your company are a mess, they can still back off and resign. This is not what we want. We want to recruite the right person, and also to keep them.

That's exactly why we want a good onboarding guide. We want every thing in the new hire's first day is clean and efficient.
