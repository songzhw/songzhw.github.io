# Onboarding Guide
I find there are not many blog talking about the onboarding guide, but I personally think this is quite important. That's why I wrote a post about it.

## 1. Why you should care about onboarding guide
If you are a manager and in charge of recruiting people, congratulations, you can make some important decisions for your team. But I have to warn you that candidates accepting your offer is not an end. I saw a couple of teams made this mistake. And this is a reason why I write this.

I personally think the most two important job of a team leader are : recruiting the right person, and managing the development process, so you can deliver a good product on time.

After you recruit a right peoson, this is just a begining. If you give the new hire a bad impression, and make them think your company are a mess, they can still back off and resign. This is not what we want. We want to recruite the right person, and also to keep them.

That's exactly why we want a good onboarding guide. We want every thing in the new hire's first day is clean and efficient.


## 2. Onboarding Document
Most managers are very busy in every day, and don't have too much time to be with the new hire. Then it's quite necessary to have one document for the new hire.  

Take the mobile development team for an example, you should contain at least the following things in your onboard guide document.
* Introduction.
    * brief introduction to the company
    * introduction to this department
    * introduction to departments in this company that he/she may interact with in the future.
    * introduction to this team (p.s. You should have a link to list all the memeber in this team. It would be even better if every team member has a picture in this link.)
    * introduction to the app we are making right now.
    
* The first things the new hire need to do.
    * What's the wifi name and password
    * Do people need a VPN to connect internal network? If it is, provide him/her the user name and the ovpn file.
    * How to setup the email on Mac
    * How to access the jira/stack/hipchat/slack?
    * How to access the code repository?
    
* Code base
    * Where is the code repository. (Do we need a VPN to access it?)
    * What is the Git policy?
        * Which one is the main branch(develop? master?)
        * Do we have a release branch;
        * Which branch should we branch off if we want to fix a bug?
        * Which branch should we branch off if we want to start a new feature?
    
    
* Serveral other important things
    * the time to work and to leave.  Or is the work hour flexible?
    * lunch break. When is the lunch break? How long is the lunch break?
    * Do we need to punch in and punch out every day?
    * If the new hire has some personal issues, and wants to take a day off, how should he/she inform you?
    * When is stand-up meeting every day?
    * How long is one sprint? How many sprints do we need to release a new version?
