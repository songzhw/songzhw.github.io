## Introduction

This is actually one of a series posts which mostly focus on several critical issue of "react-like" framework. This post is mostly focus on the Jetpack Compose UI. All the posts are:
* [Jetpack Compose version](https://github.com/songzhw/songzhw.github.io/blob/master/and_archi/2021-08-31-compose-issues.md)
* [React Native version](https://github.com/songzhw/songzhw.github.io/blob/master/react/2021-09-11-rn-issues.md)
* [Flutter version](https://github.com/songzhw/songzhw.github.io/blob/master/flutter/2021-10-01-flutter-issues.md)

## I. Re-render issue
One of the biggest performance issue in the React Native is the re-render issue. Let's say we have a parent and child:

```javascript
function Parent() {
  // it has two props/states: A , B
  return (
    <Text text={A}/>
    <Child prop={B}>
  )
}
```

Every time the prop A changes, it will refresh the Parent component/View, which means it will generate a new instance of `Child` and `Text`. 

But it's really unnecessary, as `Child` only depends on prop B. The parent ask child to re-render based on a irrelevant prop(A), that's kind of awful. 

Of course, you can add `React.memo()` or `shouldComponentUpdate()` to do a guard code, but it feels so dumb that it relies on the dev to do this. React, as the system, should do a better job in differing, and know what needs to change, and what does not.  

P.S. Android's Jetpack Compose can do a better diff algorithnm, so I guess it's not harsh to ask React Native to do so as well. 

## II. Long list performance

## II. Long list performance

### 2.1 Issues on React Native
React Native's latest view for List is the `FlatList`. It's powerful as it's easy to use, extend (such as the refresh header, the bottomView, load more pages, ...). However, it has a serious performance blackhole. 

#### 1). item layout
To get a better performance, you need to calculate every item's height and offset from the top. I never saw such a case that dev have to calculate the size of ListView item in any platform. Not ListView/RecyclerView, not UITableView, not the ListView in Flutter, ... 

I personally think React Native is wasting every dev's time to ask dev to calculate the position for each item. 

#### 2). initialNumberToRender
To get a better performance, you can point how many items you want to render when you open the page. 

Same comments here, no other platform has asked dev to do so. It's the React Native's responsibility to show just enough items where they are just enough to display in one screen. 

#### 3). Long list
React Native is doing terribly in this area. If you have 100 items in the list, RN will load all of them in the memory. I, acutally, has such a memory issue in my company's app. The list we had is using pagination, and the JS render frame rate is just dropping to 0ps, and the memory is just keeping growing when we load more and more pages. It's really a pain for the dev to handle it for you list. 

This is the performance of when I open the screen:

This is what I got when I load several more pages:

### 2.2 Is there a solution?
Yeah, lucy for us, there is such a third-party libraryin the the Github. [Flipkart/recyclerlistview](https://github.com/Flipkart/recyclerlistview) is just like the RecyclerView in android, and it will reuses views that are no longer visible, instead of createing new objects. So you memory will not explode. 

This library has 3.8K, and has been used for several years, and it's updating recently. So it sounds like a stable and reliable library for you to use. However, this is, after all, not a official view, so I don't know if it will keep being stable and reliable.
