# How to become a React Native Developer in 2019?

My team started to use React Native since 2018. As an Android Developer, I also started to learn React Native from scatch. I used to learn Node.js before, but I've never used JavaScript to write UI code. In the process of learning, I do have encoutered a lot of pitfalls and have some experience about how to learning React Native. This post is a good guide for anyone who has a developer background, and also want to learn React Native. Now let's start with what should we learn at first.

## I. JavaScript
If you are a developer in Java/C#/Swift/Kotlin/Ruby/Python, you may be okay with JavaScript. At least, you can read most of the JS code. However, unlike any programming language I mentioned above, JS have a couple of things that may confuse you as you continue to use it:

* JavaScript has no class. (Even the 'class' definition in ES6 is still a function under the hood. Oh, you ask what is ES6? We will cover it later)

* JavaScript has no thread.  But it still have async operations.

* "this" in JavaScript is quite different from Java or other OO language. You will get a lot of errors if you don't understand the concept of "this" in JavaScript.

For helping you really understand JavaScript, I recommend these books or posts for you: 

[[book] JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.ca/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Pages/dp/0596805527)

[Understanding 'this' keyword in JavaScript](https://medium.com/quick-code/understanding-the-this-keyword-in-javascript-cb76d4c7c5e8)

## II. ES6
Can you imagine a Java world without for-each, streaming, lambda, enum, and other useful features? Yes, Java 1 to Java 4 are that kind of worlds. For JavaScript, the JS before ES6 is like a raw country. JS after ES6 are the one that's really sweet.

Yes, you may think ES6 is like a new version, a higher version of JS. With ES6, you can use:

* class (like most of other programming languages)

* Promise (like RxJava in Java)

* async, await (like coroutine in Kotlin)

* generator (like Generator in Python)

* decorator (like Decorator in Python)

* ... ... 


I do have a great ES6 book to recommend, [ECMAScript 6 入门](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/) however, it's in Chinses. Lucky for us, there are tons of posts to introduce ES6. You are feel to google them.
